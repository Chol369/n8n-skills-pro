# 🚀 Introducing n8n-skills-pro: Comprehensive Skills for AI-Assisted n8n Development

Hey n8n community! 👋

I've built **n8n-skills-pro** - a collection of 10 specialized skills that help AI assistants (like Claude Code) work more effectively with n8n.

## What's included:
- 10 specialized skills (workflow architect, patterns, node config, MCP tools, etc.)
- 545+ node configurations with operation-aware setup
- Python external libraries guide (pandas, numpy, requests)
- Community fixes for common issues
- Weekly updates synced to n8n releases

## Why I built this:
Existing n8n skills are great but often outdated. n8n releases almost daily, and documentation falls behind. This project consolidates best practices and maintains active updates.

## Get started:
https://github.com/Chol369/n8n-skills-pro

Would love your feedback and contributions!
